# DictionaryRecorder

# Installation

Tested with python 3.7.4

To install requirements run (via a terminal in the top-level directory):

`py -m pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
`

This will install all the required modules and their correct versions.

ffmpeg is needed for the conversion to mp3. You may need to add this to your path, so if the conversion fails then try this.


# Running the program
To run the program, from the top-level directory use the command:

`
py main.py
`

Then follow the onscreen instructions.
